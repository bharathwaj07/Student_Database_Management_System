# Student_Database_Management_System
•	It’s a web application helps to track and update student’s records includes personal and academic details (extracurricular activities, all internal and semester results).
•	Additionally, added features like daily attendance system, leave approving system and payment system (exam fees and mess bill via online through debit card).
•	Project divided into three phases:
	Admin HOD (access to add or remove students & facilitators, update reviews of both, approve on duty and leave).
	Facilitator (add his/her personal details, update paper conference/journal, update student mark details and also approve on duty and leave.
	Student (add his/her personal details, update certificate, map daily attendance, request on duty and leave, pay exam fees and mess bill).
•	We generated QR code for every student individually in Identity card based on roll no. and stored student entire information on it.
•	Developed code using PHP (front-end) & Mysql (back-end).
•	Proud to say”**this project has been implemented in college and it worked successfully**.”
